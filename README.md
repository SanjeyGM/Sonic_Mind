🧠 Sonic Mind
AI-Powered Meeting Summarizer Using Voice and LLMs

Sonic Mind is an intelligent meeting summarization system that converts spoken conversations into structured, concise summaries using speech processing and large language models (LLMs). It captures voice input, transcribes it into text, and analyzes the content to extract key points, action items, and important decisions.

The system is designed to help teams, students, and professionals save time by automatically generating clear summaries from meetings, discussions, or voice recordings.
